# Rise of REST services and Rich clients

At Worldline Lyon, 2010 was the year of large architectures powered by REST Web Services.
We were leaving an area dominated by monolithic SOAP back-end, and starting to look up at scalable stateless services.

With a bunch of colleages we believed in the value of [Spring Framework][3], and in its capability to sustain multiple teams of numerous java developers.
We also quickly felt the need to bring Object Oriented patterns into JavaScript Web application (also named Rich clients).

[Resthub][1] was born, including a backend Spring stack to create REST stateless APIs, and a JavaScript framework upon [JQuery][2] inspired by [Sammy.js][4] and [JavaScriptMVC][5].

The initial team included Sebastien Deleuze and Brian Clozel (now both part of the Spring Core Team) Baptiste Meurant, Loïc Fréring, Julien Vilani and I.

# Technologies used

I contribute a little to the [Java part][22], that was using [Tomcat][14], Spring and [Spring Security][15], [Jersey][18] and Jackson (serialization), [Hibernate][16] and [Hibernate Search][17].

But my [major contribution][23] was on the JavaScript part, that was providing :

- OOP with classes and inheritance
- An event bus for data/action brokerage
- a Router based on hashed urls with parameter
- Controllers, Templates (jQuery.tmpl) and JQueryUI widget
- Repositories, to interract with a REST API
- i18n mechanism
- OAuth2 as authentication mecanism during REST API calls
- Logging, local storage,
- And [RequireJS][20] as dependencies loader.

Spring 2012, it becames clear that using an in-house JavaScript framework was not the best choice.
Only relying on our shoulder, it could not compete with flagships like Dojo, Backbone, Meteor...

So we trash it, and start using an opiniated [Backbone][19] + RequireJS + [Handlebars][21] combination.

On the Java part, it evolved to use [Spring Data][9] and even [AMQP/Hessian RPC][8]. But I had stopped writing Java since several months...

# In-house... until the end

Resthub was intensively used at Worldline, for middle to large size projects, including the French National Geographic Portal ([IGN portal][6]) and Orange Telco [Mobile applications shop][7].
He's still used in production, and until late 2014, actively developed.

But despite our efforts, (Blog posts, Meetups at [Lyon][11] and [Grenoble][10], and even [Devoxx 2010][12] and [TakeOff 2013][13] conferences), it never became popular enough to be used outside Worldline.

We're still glad to see that is was an ancestor of [Spring Boot][24] and [Java Hipster][25] {% include icon.html src='emoticon-tongue' %}.
