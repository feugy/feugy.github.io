*Work in progress*

# Game engine as a Service - powered by Resthub.js

If you've never heard about Mythic-Forge, have a look at the [first version]({% post_url 2009-04-06-mythic-forge-v1 %}).

After a first implentation with a Java-based server and two Flex web applications, it was obvious that Flex was not the right solution.

At work, we were using the [Resthub][1] framwork since several months, from which I was an active [contributor]({% post_url 2010-07-20-resthub %}).

It was the perfect opportunity to combine pleasure and work, and Mythic-forge saw its authoring and game UI replaced with JavaScript applications (respectively Promotheus and Japet).
