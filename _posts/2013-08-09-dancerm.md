# Helping digitalization

[Ribas Dance School][ribas]{:target='_blank'} count more than 300 members every year.
Owned by Diana and Anthony, both Ballroom dance teachers, it employs two more teachers for Modern Jazz and Hip Hop.

Until 2013, registration was only made by hand, which is an humongous work because registration only last 2 weeks in september,
and when it comes to track payments that span on the whole year.

Asked by Anthony, I developped a dance-specific CRM application.
Constraints was to be desktop and offline (at this time, the school had no internet connection), very simple (they are dance teachers, not secretaries), and centered on dance classes.
