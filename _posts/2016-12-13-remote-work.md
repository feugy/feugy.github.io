# A Lighning talk

As you may know, I'm working remotely from France with [nearForm][nearform] since March 2016.

This is a great experience, which I had an opportunity to describe during a monthly session of Lyon's [Human Talks][humantalks].

We had five talks of 15 minutes each (speech: 10, questions: 5), about electic topics like "Module bundlers in JS", "Genetic algorithms" or even "Fear of the blank page". Mine was to relate my current situation.

# Changing my (professional) life

After almost ten years as developer, lead developer and software architect at [Worldline][awl], I needed to shake my own dust.
Following the example of [Maxence][maxired], a friends of mine, I looked for a remote job.

My main goals were to challenge myself against top developers and have more flexible working hours so I could train better and be more with my familly. Working for nearForm brought me all that, but also much much more.

Being a remote worker is a brand new experience for me, and even if I tried to prepare myself, it's a big change.

Of course, everyone can forsee that working from home will make you more lonely, and will require self discipline.
But I didn't realised the impact it had on my own familly, and even my own morale.

# Remote work talk

This talk was the opportunity to share this ongoing experience:

- my motivations
- the challenged I've met
- tools I use to organise my daily life
- what keeps me doing it

I was delighted to face a small yet interested audience, who had some questions and constructive reactions.
I hope I can do a longer version of it in the future, and maybe gather more thought and tricks from my remote colleagues !

Here are the slides:
