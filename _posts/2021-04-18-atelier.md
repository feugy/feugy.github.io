# Yet another workbench?

Atelier (French word for workbench or workshop) is a simple UI component explorer, like [angular-playground] [react-cosmos], [storybook], [styleguidist], [svench] or [chromatic].

A workbench help you implementing [Component Driven Development][cdd]: crafting reusable UI components in isolation.

Now, about the elephant in the room:

> _Storybook is a wonderful tool_. Do we need a bad clone of it?

In my experience, Storybook does not bring an enjoyable developer experience, mostly because of webpack (as the time of writing).

A lot of people throw a lot of effort to improve it for common cases, leading to powerfull starterkits like [create-react-app], and many blogpost (try searching for "storybook + nextjs" üòâ).

However, if your project is not react-based, you're very likely to be forced rewriting an entire webpack configuration, leading to a very fragile and unefficient setup. On medium-sized code base, build time is significant, and becomes a barrier to CDD.

Atelier seamlessly integrates with [Vite] bundler, and give you back control. It has bindings for Svelte, and thanks to Vite's capabilities, will eventually support Vue and React.

# How does it work?

The code is organized in an mono-repository.

1. `@atelier-wb/plugin-svelte`, is a vite plugin that starts atelier UI

   In your `vite.config.js` file, add:

   ```js
   import svelte from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";
   // other vite plugins
   import atelier from "@atelier-wb/vite-plugin-svelte";

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [svelte(), /* other plugins */ atelier()],
   });
   ```

   It will run the Atelier UI (I call it the "frame") at http://localhost:3000/, and will update it every time you change your components.

1. `@atelier-wb/ui`, contains the UI frame: a component explorer, and several panels to list triggered event, and tweak component properties.
   It is built with Svelte, but this does not really matters since users will run a compiled version.

   It also has an iframe to host the tested component, and control the display size.

1. `@atelier-wb/svelte`, the Svelte language bindings, which allows users to write "Tools" for their components:

   ```js
   <script>
     import { Tool } from '@atelier-wb/svelte'
     import MyComponent from '../src/MyComponent.svelte'
   </script>

   <Tool name="Components/My component" component={MyComponent} />
   ```

   These bindings will allow the UI tweaking component properties, and listening to its events.

1. `@atelier-wb/toolshot`, an equivalent of [storyshot][], that is a collection of snapshots for your components, so you can find structural regressions as part of your Jest test suite.

# What's next?

More documentation, examples, and a couple of features, like React support and a way to filter the explorer.

I would love Atelier to look better, so I need to poke my designer friends for some help üòÅ
